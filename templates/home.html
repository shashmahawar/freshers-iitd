        Hola Freshers, <br><br>
        Welcome to a whole new life! After two grueling years of JEE preparation, we're sure you must be dying to live it up a little. Let me be the first one to assure you that this first year of years is gonna give you a lot more than you can ever expect. Lifelong friendships and romances, crazy adventures, deadlines that never indeed die, and much more are all coming along your way. <br><br>
        Some of you will probably be VERY socially awkward and unsure what to do. Many confusing thoughts might be running through your mind regarding many subjects. We, your seniors here at IIT Delhi, would love nothing more than to ease this process for you guys. <br><br>
        So, we present you to this website where you can get access to all the resources offered to you by IIT peeps. Here, you're gonna decipher all the weird terminology of Kerberos IDs, fachche, and of course, the quintessential BTs and the fundae to float through them. <br><br>
        Wishing you all the best, and hoping you learn the IITian motto soon: Agala Sem Phodenge!
